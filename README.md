# Bayesian Network Encounter Models

The Bayesian network encounter models are a collection of MATLAB scripts that produce random samples from models of how different aircraft behave, as previously documented in MIT Lincoln Laboratory technical reports. All these models were originally developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Majority of these samples are of one independent aircraft track and a single sample is insufficient for a complete synthetic encounter. Refer to the [`em-overview/README`](https://github.com/Airspace-Encounter-Models/em-overview/blob/master/README.md#documentation) for model documentation. Also please refer to other software and documentation on how to fully generate an encounter.

Each manned aircraft model model is a Bayesian Network, a representation of a multivariate probability distribution as a directed acyclic graph. Models are trained using aircraft operational data derived from radar or other sensing system flight track data. For example, the following figure illustrates the initial Bayesian network for the extended uncorrelated encounter model.

## Run Order

This section specifies the initial setup and run order for the repository.

### Persistent System Environment Variable

Immediately after cloning this repository, [create a persistent system environment](https://superuser.com/q/284342/44051) variable titled `AEM_DIR_BAYES` with a value of the full path to this repository root directory.

On unix there are many ways to do this, here is an example using [`/etc/profile.d`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/117473). Create a new file `aem-env.sh` using `sudo vi /etc/profile.d/aem-env.sh` and add the command to set the variable:

```bash
export AEM_DIR_BAYES=PATH TO /em-model-manned-bayes
```

You can confirm `AEM_DIR_BAYES` was set in unix by inspecting the output of `env`.

### Sample the Model

 The main function is [`em_sample`](./code/matlab/em_sample.m) and we provide a run script,[`RUN_1_emsample`](./code/matlab/RUN_1_emsample.m), which calls the function. The function's input is are parameter files that describe the model's properties. The parameter files are located in the [model directory](./model/README.md).

### Generate Basic Tracks

The run script, [`RUN_2_sample2track`](./code/matlab/RUN_2_sample2track.m), calls [`sample2track`](./code/matlab/sample2track.m) to generate basic (x,y,z) tracks for some of the model samples. Not all model samples are supported and only uncorrelated, glider (unconventional), and paraglider (unconventional) samples have been tested with the function.

## Datafiles and Documentation

Refer to the [`em-overview/README`](https://github.com/Airspace-Encounter-Models/em-overview/blob/master/README.md#documentation) for references to the technical documentation for each model.

### Primary RADES-Based Models

Bayesian network models trained using 1200-code aircraft tracks or encounters between transponder-equipped (cooperative) aircraft. Training data for the extended models was sourced from over 200 ground-based air surveillance radars managed by the RADES. The extended correlated model was trained from more than 500,000 flight hours and the extended uncorrelated from more than 290,000 flight hours. The following figure illustrates the maximum theoretical surveillance volume for each radar. Actual radar range varies based on a variety of factors, such as altitude and nearby terrain.

There are two models trained with RADES data and each model has been updated once to enable extended simulation times. The correlated model is the only model that explicitly models two aircraft.

### Unconventional Model

This set of models were trained using more than 96,000 global unconventional aircraft tracks. Training data was sourced from multiple continents but the trained model does not include a geographic variable.
